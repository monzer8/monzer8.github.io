      <description>This is my first blog entry Basketball is my favorite sport. There is nothing I love more than watching a good NBA game. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant. I watched him when I was just starting to get introduced to the sport. Although he has unfortunately passed, I believe his legacy still lives on. He is in all honesty the biggest idol in my life. This is a picture of him.</description>
