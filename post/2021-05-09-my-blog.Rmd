## This is my first blog entry

Basketball is my favorite sport. There is nothing I love more than watching a good NBA game. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant. I watched him when I was just starting to get introduced to the sport. Although he has unfortunately passed, I believe his legacy still lives on. He is in all honesty the biggest idol in my life. This is a picture of him. ![](/post/2021-05-09-my-blog_files/Kobe.jpeg)

In this Blog, I will first list my opinions of Kobe, and then I will put up some facts. So first, I will put some of my own opinions. Again, these are my opinions and if you disagree I would love to have this debate. I understand my opinions are controversial but let me put some context to my opinion. So first, I was always one of the tallest people in my school so from the get-go I was put into basketball. I never really took the time to watch the game and see the beauty of it so I honestly did not care too much about it. However, things all changed for me in 2008. I was at a sports facility getting in shape since I was overweight as a child and as I waited for my parents to pick me up I watched the TV. It happened to be the 2008 NBA finals which featured the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics bested the Lakers in 6 games but everyday I went to the camp, I watch Kobe Bryant put in work. I was so amazed by his unbeleivable skill set and talent. That's when I fell in love with basketball. I went home and pulled up YouTube videos of him and I watched hours of highlights and games. I spent the next years immersing myself in the sport. I lived and breathed NBA basketball from that moment on. I always went out of my way to stay up late to watch Kobe and the Lakers since they played in west they always had their games at 7-8 PST. I learned a ton from watching him and became a pretty damn good basketball player myself. However, the best thing that Kobe did for me was change my outlook on life and my attitude. In all honesty, I was a lazy kid, but from watching Kobe play and reading about him I learned to work hard and give it my all. I believe I am an incredibly hard worker and I always strive to be the best that I can be. So ya, this guy is an all-time legend but to me it was more than that. So without further ado, these are some of my opinions of him:
```{python} 
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest basketball player I have ever seen")
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest Laker of all-time")
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest clutch player of all-time in NBA history")
print("Kobe Bryant is the most skilled basketball player of all-time")
print("Kobe Bryant had to face the toughest competition being in the western conference but somehow ended up being a 5-time world champion")
print("Kobe Bryant is the best 2-way player of all time. Meaning offense and defense")
```
These are my opinions, but they mean nothing without facts. Let's get into some basic facts about Kobe. I wont throw in any numbers or advanced statistics. I can provide all that in a later blog post, but for now, these are some facts about Kobe Bryant that I think you all should know:
