## This is my first blog entry

Basketball is my favorite sport. There is nothing I love more than watching a good NBA game. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant. I watched him when I was just starting to get introduced to the sport. Although he has unfortunately passed, I believe his legacy still lives on. He is in all honesty the biggest idol in my life. This is a picture of him. ![](/post/2021-05-09-my-blog_files/Kobe.jpeg)

These are some of my opinions of him:
```{python} 
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest basketball player I have ever seen")
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest Laker of all-time")
print("Kobe Bryant is the greatest clutch player of all-time in NBA history")
```
Now, these are some facts about Kobe Bryant:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
kobe <- "5 NBA Championships"
kobe1 <- "2 NBA Finals MVP Awards"
kobe2 <- "1 NBA MVP Award"
kobe3 <- "4th All-time Leading Scorer in NBA History"
kobe4 <- "Most Game Winners in NBA History"
kobe5 <- "Played 20 Seasons with the Lakers, Most in Franchise History"
kobe6 <- "Came to the NBA Straight Out of High School"
```

```{python}
print(r.kobe)
print(r.kobe1)
print(r.kobe2)
print(r.kobe3)
print(r.kobe4)
print(r.kobe5)
print(r.kobe6)
```

So, you tell me. What does Kobe Bryant mean to you?
